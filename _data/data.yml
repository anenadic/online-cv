    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Over the past 5 years committed to ongoing improvement of research software practice through training and community 
      engagement work. Driving the training trends forward by helping communities roll out new training strategies and develop curricula 
      for research in individual domains. Maintaining the UK’s pivotal role within the international research training community 
      by running events, helping organisations and individuals deliver training for researchers in programming and data 
      analysis skills, driving key strategic decisions and handling national and international collaborations and outreach 
      with different research and training communities.
      
      Prior to this, worked as software engineer and gained experience in a variety of platforms, infrastructures, technologies
